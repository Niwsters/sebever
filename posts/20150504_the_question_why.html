<h1>The question why</h1>
<p>Many people assume that web development is all about technical skills. You need to know how to set up a server. Then you need to install Wordpress (unless you're pro and make it from scratch). Finally, you do all that mumbo jumbo web guru stuff, and boom, you got a website.</p>

<p>I can assure you, this is almost always far, far from the truth. Most of all about making it from scratch. The reason? Well, there are several. But to make it simple to you I'll sum it up with one word:</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>I once started making a member registry system for a non profit organisation. Half a year into the work, someone came up to me and said, "Hey I found this Google Forms thing!" I realized I had reinvented the wheel. And a bad one at that. Full of bugs, unflexible, hard to maintain. How could I keep up with Google? And why would I? I gave up on the project and moved on to updating their Wordpress texts.</p>

<p>Another time, I was remaking a website for another organisation. I chose Drupal which is a very flexible and developer-friendly system. Very powerful. I also decided to redesign the whole site. I wanted to make all of it beautiful, awesome, professional.</p>

<p>I showed some design ideas to the chairperson of the board. It was probably the best thing I've ever done. She told me this:</p>

<p>"This design is made to sell products. We don't sell products."</p>

<p>And later on, as I was getting frustrated:</p>

<p>"You don't HAVE to remake the design, you know."</p>

<p>And that's when I made the (quoting some people) best website of the whole student union at my university. By copying the old design and just making some static pages.</p>

<p>The key to all of these projects is the question why. Why do we need an online member registry? Why would the website need a new design? Most of all, why should the website even exist?</p>

<p>Once I started asking myself these questions, the quality of my work has risen rapidly. I even do it quicker. Because every thing I create has a purpose. If it doesn't, I don't do it. Every page has a thought behind it, a goal it wants to achieve, and it makes almost everything I do worth the time.</p>

<p>It's the key to efficiency - the worth you create for every minute you invest.</p>

<p>Now, to give you one final example to show you what I mean. Look at this website. What do you see? Carousels? My CV? Cluttered buttons everywhere? Hopefully not. Because I have no reason to show such things.</p>

<p>I've carefully asked myself what I want this website to do. I want to share my projects and my thoughts. I want that to help and entertain people. Because it's fun. That's three whys in a row - I share to help and entertain because it's fun. Everything else is secondary. After I figured that out, it only took me a couple of hours to make it from scratch. Had I used Wordpress, it would've taken one. But that wouldn't have been as fun, now, would it?</p>

<p>So, to summarize: Always ask why. It leads to efficiency. And efficiency is, in the end, all you need.</p>
