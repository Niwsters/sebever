What is inspiration?

I google'd the definition and came up empty. Even Wikipedia seemed very uncertain of the topic:

"Inspiration refers to an unconscious burst of creativity in a literary, musical, or other artistic endeavour."

And with uncertain I of course mean that I completely disagree with the definition. To me it's very conscious. It's something I get from observation. Whenever I'm stuck in whatever I'm doing it always helps to observe others do similar things, or even completely different sometimes. It's like being frustrated about love and telling your friend about it, and your friend comforts you and makes you see the greatness of your passionate dreams about this or that person's loving embrace. Only, it's not about a person but about a project or problem that needs fixing and doing.

Inspiration is a way to feel in control of a problem you're very passionate about. Like watching a great artist make paintings with ease. Of course it'd be just as easy for you, you just need to try! It's a sudden burst of trust in yourself. Then you try and, well, it disappears. You need new inspiration and new ideas. And such things don't come automatically.

I am not sure how much sense this description makes to you, but to me it's perfectly clear: Inspiration is trust achieved by observation. It's that simple. And whenever you feel uninspired, just go out there and observe. The world will surprise you with its loving embrace.
