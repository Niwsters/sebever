I often get the question why I don't study IT. To me, it feels obvious. Software and computers is what I learn at home. That said, different people choose different paths to achieve their goals, and learning software development is no exception.

I started off with a game called Notrium, made by independent game developer Ville Mönkkönen. Just something I found on a PC Gaming disc ages ago. After trying it out for a while, without even finishing it, I found that I wanted to make mods. I was 11 years old.

After joining the forums I quickly found their IRC channel, #monkkonenchat. There I met a bunch of mildly arrogant but friendly fans of Ville and his games. They helped me with the modding. Then after picking up programming, they helped me with that. With their help, and many years of frustration, I learned some basic C++ and Java coding.

At first, I wanted to make games. This proved very, very difficult. Not only did I lack knowledge in programming, but I had to make graphics, do game design, use complex code architecture to be able to make anything. I took long breaks of frustration, sometimes up to half a year. But after a while I found myself improving.

If this makes software development sound frightening to you, remember that I was an overachieving high schooler by then as well. I was young, impatient and busy with grades and relationships. Many people study part of what I was trying to do at a university program. I was trying to do it all by myself.

Then, in the beginning of my last game idea, I got a job offer. Professor Vinod Diwan at Karolinska Institute was looking for an innovative programmer for this project he wanted to do. It had nothing to do with what I knew.
