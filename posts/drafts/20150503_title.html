Routines are the space that allows creativity to flourish.

Beautiful code doesn't make great software. But they make a better developer.

What makes the difference between a successful project and a failed one is the person executing it. By becoming a better person you improve the chances of achieving what you want. And that's awesome.

This is the reason why failures lead to success. When I consider all the failed websites I've made I notice a pattern.
