The question why
Sometimes, technology gets the upper hand of us. [examples...]

I remember trying to buy a metro ticket on the phone a couple of years ago. The technology was still new so it was a bit problematic. That time I didn't even receive it. I obviously didn't want to buy a new one, it was quite expensive, so I told the ticket inspector about the problem and showed him I had sent the text.

"No, you need a proper ticket."

I wasn't really surprised by this response. It was in Stockholm. Their public transit is unforgiving. I later on walked to the next stop where the inspector there let me through with a stern face telling me not to tell anyone he did so.

This problem I think serves as a perfect example of humans being servants to technology, rather than the other way around. They used to have a great ticket system. Why did they change it? What made it better? Although the idea of using your cellphone to buy tickets is really cool (at least back then), it seemed to create more problems than it solved.
