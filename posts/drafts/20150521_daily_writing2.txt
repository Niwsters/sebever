Mentorship is an artform. It's not something you do overnight and be done with. It's a constant process of forming what really makes a difference to the people who need your help. As if making a painting you fill your pupils with colourful inspiration, give them your trusty brush strokes and, with some luck, bring them to realize a new part of their limitless potential.
