A nonprofit's guide to web development

Plot highlights:
* The purpose of purpose - why the website needs a reason to exist.
* Goals and tactics. How do we give people what they're looking for?
* Design and technical stuff. Routines, conventions, experience and, most importantly, making mistakes.
* Iterative testing! Get those judgmental gears going.
* Publishing, fine-tuning and long-term thinking. When is the website actually DONE?! And who will maintain my sweet piece of art?

The subject: A service-oriented nonprofit organisation providing therapy for cats.

Misc. ideas: Don't go into detail about the technical stuff. Instead, link to tutorials that explain this and encourage exploration and problem solving.

The purpose of a good website is deeply connected to the organisation's culture and trademark. It can also be a great tool for putting words on those.
