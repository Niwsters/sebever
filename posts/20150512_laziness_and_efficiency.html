<h1>Laziness and efficiency</h1>

A thought struck me while I was biking home. You see, ever since primary school I've always had this feeling that strikes me every time I try to do certain things. Things that don't seem to matter. Like when I wrote that short story for the Swedish class in primary school. I KNEW the teacher wouldn't care about it. I KNEW that I would get the same grade as always. So why do it? I hated every single minute of it. And that short story, together with pretty much half my essays and stories and such in primary school, was handed in several weeks late.

Many people saw this as lazy. My mother saw it as fear of writing. I never received any compliments or encouragement from my teacher. At the same time I was always writing on my blog. And I was learning programming by myself. So I wasn't that lazy. And neither was I afraid of writing. However, there was no point whatsoever in writing yet another long text so that my teacher could give me critique that I didn't agree with. So in my mind I was saving time. I was being efficient.

I believe laziness is misunderstood like this. No, I'm certain of it. I also believe that many people, like me, have a natural tendency to not spend time with what we don't believe in. Is there no point to it? Then don't do it! Do something important instead.

<h2>Feedback is key</h2>
Of course there are tasks that can feel pointless yet can really make a difference. But to truly be efficient we want to <em>know</em> if it does. That's when feedback comes in. It's the key to any efficient project management. And it's very common too! Programmers do their unit testing to make sure every single line of their code matters. Event planners use surveys to see how their work affected the thoughts and lives of their visitors. Teachers let their students ask questions and make mistakes so they know what they should explain. All this is feedback. Without it we're lost, wondering if we'll ever finish this pointless essay.

<h2>How to lead the lazy</h2>
This is also important in another aspect - leadership. Take the example with my short story again. Imagine if I would've received compliments and encouragement. No, not the fake one where I get loads of compliments from nothing. I mean actually looking at my half-finished, crappy short story and letting me know all the progress I've made. The interesting character idea I had. My unique, personal way of writing.

Then, give me inspiration. Tell me how I should describe the landscape I'm imagining in my head, not just mention it. Show me some book where it is done really well and let me copy from it. That, more than anything, would've given me motivation enough to finish the short story with quality and joy. And I wouldn't waste one single minute of my life doing it. That's, to me, is the definition of good leadership.

<h2>Summary</h2>
"Laziness" can be annoying to deal with but it isn't as deadly as it seems. In fact it's what helps me find time to do what I love doing. It makes me question the worth of all that I do, it makes me select those few things that actually matter, and then it leaves me to do it with full comfort and joy. It is, in the end, quite an awesome thing.
