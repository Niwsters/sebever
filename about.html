<p>In short, I'm a technology student who loves human interaction and learning.</p>

<p>I study civil engineering, taught myself software development and aim to get a double degree in engineering and teaching. I also do a lot of mentoring in mathematics on my spare time.</p>

<h2>"Why don't you study IT?"</h2>
<p>IT is a craft that I can learn anywhere, civil engineering is not. I also always wanted to build Roman aqueducts. And get a teaching degree.</p>

<h2>Technology and me</h2>
<p>The beauty of technology (to me) is how it's used. Sure I love maths, physics, programming and logics. But what I love most of all is when it helps people achieve new things.</p>
